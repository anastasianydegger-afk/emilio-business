## BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

### Fixed vs Variable Costs

**Monthly Fixed Costs (Months 4+):**
- Market booth: €240
- Instagram ads: €100-150
- **Total Fixed:** €340-390/month

**Variable Costs (per jar):**
- Jars + vegetables + salt + spices: €1.36
- Labels: €0.50
- **Total Variable:** €1.86/jar

**Break-Even Calculation:**
- Selling price: €5.00/jar
- Contribution margin per jar: €5.00 - €1.86 = €3.14
- Break-even volume: €350 / €3.14 = **111 jars/month**
- Break-even achieved in Month 1 at 90 jars ✅

**Safety margin:** (450 jars - 111 jars) / 450 = **75% safety margin** (very safe!)

| Month | Equipment | Inventory | Working Capital |
|---|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | €500 (jars, labels, etc.) | €200 (COGS) | **€700** |
| Month 2+ | €0 | €600-1000 | **€600-1000** |

---

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Current Pricing (€5.00 retail / €2.00-2.50 wholesale)

**Margin Analysis:**
- Retail: €5.00 - €1.86 COGS = **€3.14 profit/jar (63% margin)**
- Wholesale (Greens €2.00): €2.00 - €1.86 = **€0.14 profit/jar (7% margin)**
- Wholesale (Shops €2.50): €2.50 - €1.86 = **€0.64 profit/jar (26% margin)**

**Optimization:** Premium SKUs (Asparagus €6.00, Curry €5.00) pull average up to €5.25/jar

### Future Pricing (Month 9+)

**Option 1: Increase Retail (€6.00)**
- If brand strength grows, can raise to €6.00
- Target wholesale: €2.50-3.00
- New profit: €4.14/jar retail, €0.64-1.14/jar wholesale

**Option 2: Keep Current, Scale Volume**
- Stay at €5.00
- Scale to 1500+ jars/month
- Achieve €3000+/month profit via volume

---

## SCALING ASSUMPTIONS (Year 2)

### Path to €40,000+ Revenue

**Volume:** 1500-2000 jars/month
**Channels:**

- Wholesale: 60% (900-1200 jars)

**Wholesale Partners:**
- Greens (100-150 jars/month)
- 3-5 local shops (300-500 jars/month)

- **Total OpEx:** €850-1300/month

**Year 2 Net Profit Projection:** €20,000-30,000 (€1667-2500/month average)

---

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What If Wholesale Fails?

**Scenario:** No wholesale deals, remain retail-only
- Month 12 revenue: €35,000 (down from €43,000)
- Month 12 net profit: €12,000 (down from €15,867)
- **Still profitable, still viable**

### What If Cost of Goods Rises 20%?

**New COGS:** €1.86 × 1.20 = €2.23/jar
- Break-even changes: €340 / (€5.00 - €2.23) = **165 jars/month**
- Year 1 profit decreases: €15,867 - (€0.37 × 450 avg jars × 12) = **€13,267**
- **Still profitable, margin compresses but sustainable**

### What If Marketing ROI is 200% (instead of 350%)?

**Impact:** Fewer conversions, slower growth
- Volume by Month 12: ~300-400 jars (down from 700+)
- Year 1 profit: €8,000 (down from €15,867)
- **Break-even delays to Month 4-5, but still profitable**

---

## REINVESTMENT STRATEGY

### Option 1: Maximum Profit (Withdraw €1000-1500/month by Month 6)
- Keep business lean (no helpers)
- Reinvest only minimum (marketing €100/month)
- Best for solo solopreneur building personal income

### Option 2: Reinvest for Growth (Reinvest 50% of profit Month 3+)
- Hire part-time helper Month 5 (€500/month)
- Scale kitchen/equipment Month 6
- Move to commercial kitchen Month 9
- **Result:** €3000-5000/month by Year 2

### Option 3: Bootstrapped Growth (Reinvest 80% of profit)
- Hire full-time by Month 8
- Open commercial kitchen Month 6
- Launch Shopify website Month 7
- Expand to 2000+ jars/month
- **Result:** €40,000-60,000 revenue Year 2, €20,000+ profit

---

## TAX IMPLICATIONS (Malta)

**Estimated Tax Obligations:**
- Income tax: ~10-15% of net profit (self-employed in Malta)
- VAT: Only if revenue >€37,000/year (Year 1 likely under threshold)
- Social contributions: ~10% (if registered as self-employed)

**Estimated Year 1 Taxes:** €1500-2500 (reduces net profit to €13,367-14,367)

**Note:** Consult Maltese accountant for exact obligations.

---
